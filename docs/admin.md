# Admin Accounts Management

Admin accounts are required to manage users, configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), view audit logs, and access the built-in Django Administration panel. Tenxyte provides two distinct levels of administrative accounts.

## Overview

In Tenxyte, you can have a full **Superuser** (which bypasses all permission checks) or an **RBAC Admin** (a standard user assigned the `admin` or `super_admin` role). Depending on your security requirements, you might only grant Superuser status to backend developers, while support staff gets the `admin` role.

---

## 1. Django Superuser

A Django Superuser is essentially a "root" account for your application. This user has `is_superuser=True` and `is_staff=True` in the database.

### Creation

Superusers are typically created via the command line. This is almost always the very first account you create when setting up Tenxyte for the first time.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Prompt example:
```
Email address: admin@example.com
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.
```

### Capabilities

- **Bypasses RBAC:** `user.has_permission("any.permission")` always returns `True`.
- **Admin Panel Access:** Can log into `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to view raw database tables.
- **API Access:** Has implied access to every single API endpoint automatically.

*Note: You do not need to assign any RBAC roles to a Superuser.*

---

## 2. RBAC Admin Roles

An RBAC Admin is a regular user who has been assigned a powerful role (e.g., `admin` or `super_admin`). They do not have `is_superuser=True`.

### Creation

To create an RBAC Admin, the user must first register an account normally. Then, an existing Superuser or Admin can elevate them via the API:

```bash
POST /api/v1/auth/users/<user_id>/roles/
Authorization: Bearer <superuser_token>

{
  "role_codes": ["super_admin"]
}
```

Alternatively, you can elevate a user programmatically via the Django shell:

```python
# python manage.py shell
from tenxyte.models import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()

user = User.objects.get(email="manager@example.com")
user.assign_role("super_admin")
```

### Capabilities

- **Strict RBAC:** They only have the permissions explicitly granted to their role.
- **No Django Admin Access:** By default, they cannot access `/admin/` unless you also manually set `is_staff=True` on their account.
- **Safer for Teams:** Ideal for customer support, HR, or product managers who need widespread API access without raw database access.

See the [RBAC Guide](rbac.md) for details on built-in roles and permissions.
